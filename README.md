# Problem Statement
Consumers often struggle to access fresh, locally sourced produce at fair prices, while farmers face challenges in reaching buyers directly. The reliance on middlemen reduces farmers' profits and increases costs for consumers. Additionally, existing digital platforms are not designed for direct farmer-to-consumer transactions, and language barriers further limit accessibility for non-technical users. This inefficiency in the food supply chain results in economic and logistical challenges for both farmers and consumers.
